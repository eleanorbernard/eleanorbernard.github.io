        <div class="about-text"> 
            <p>Eleanor Bernard is an artist from Seattle, WA currently pursuing 
                a BFA in Painting <br>and a minor in History of Art and 
                Architecture at Boston University.
                Sheâ€™s interested in <br>creating work that appears to be in flux, depicting bodies 
                and forms that morph into one <br>another, narratives that 
                do not have a singular time or environment, and 
                using unarchival <br>materials that may 
                fade, stain and transform the work with age.
                <br><br>
                She is inspired by natural processes of growth and decay,
                 creating and growing her own materials, good music, and her older sister.
